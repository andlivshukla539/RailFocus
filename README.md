## 🚉 What is RailFocus?

RailFocus is not just another Pomodoro timer — it's an **immersive productivity experience** built around the romance of golden-age rail travel. Every focus session is a train journey. Every completed hour builds your Grand Station. Every streak unlocks something beautiful.

Built with **Flutter** for a smooth cross-platform experience, **Firebase** for real-time cloud sync, and **Hive** for a rock-solid offline-first foundation.
